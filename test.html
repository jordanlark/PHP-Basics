<h2>CHRIS BRISENO, Public Relations and Program Assistant</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Chris Briseno and I was born in Ogden, Utah. I have one older brother and two step-sisters. I grew up in Salt Lake City. While I was living in Salt Lake with my dad and step-mom, I went to St. Ann's Catholic School for a while. I moved to Kearns where I went to West Kearns and Bennion Jr. High School. I left Bennion Jr. High School in the middle of ninth grade, I moved out from my dad and step-mom's house in Kearns, and I moved in with my mom and step-dad in Layton in 1991. I went to Central Davis Jr. High. That is when I started Special Olympics. From Central Davis Jr. High, I went to Layton High School and graduated in 1995. I used to work for J.C.-Hi-Hat in Riverdale, and after that I worked in a daycare. I started working for Special Olympics in 1999.</p>

<p>Special Olympics Utah has changed my life around from being a shy young man to being a grown up. It gets me out of the house and I started hanging around people. It takes me a while to come out of my shell, and I hang around people and made lots of friends, too. Special Olympics teaches me it is okay if I win or don't win, but that I do my best. The sports I am doing are track and field, swimming, basketball, golf, softball, soccer, bocce, volleyball, bowling and snowshoeing. I have gotten to travel to different places with Special Olympics. My favorite place that I went to is North Carolina for softball.</p>

<p>My job is writing 'thank you' notes to the people who write to us and I also call them to thank them, too. I put medical forms into the computer. I am also a global messenger, and I go with my coworkers and talk about Special Olympics.</p>

<p>In my free time, I like going to the movies with my friends or reading a book or going for a walk to Wal-Mart. I love to visit with my nephew and nieces.</p>
